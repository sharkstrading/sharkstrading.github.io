# Copy trading instructions

## I don't have a trading account yet

[Choose your broker on this page (look for `cTrader Copy Available`)](https://ctrader.com/featured-brokers/)

Protip: check in advance with the broker if they support cTrader Copy in your jurisdiction. For example, IC Markets supports cTrader Copy only in the Seychelles jurisdiction, but not in the EU.

## I (already) have a cTrader account

Check if you have a Full Member (FM) trading account, otherwise you will not be able to copy any trades.

To check this, log in to https://ct.spotware.com and on the left click Copy. You should see the `FM` clearly for your account like this:

If your account doesn't have the `FM` badge it's either a Demo account or you unfortunately created a non-Full Member account and have to treat your colleagues to cake üç∞

## I have a Full Member Account

Well done! After logging in to your Super Mega Ultra Pro Full Member Account, go to our strategy page

After starting the strategy you will notice that funds were deducted from your account and placed in a segregated account, just for this strategy. This segregated account will be active for as long as you copy the strategy. Also, it will track the ROI on the right side.
