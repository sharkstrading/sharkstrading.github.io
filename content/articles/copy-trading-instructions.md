# Copy trading instructions

## I don't have a trading account yet

If you want you can use the same broker that we use so that there are no headaches: [Get me a working account, on the double!](https://www.icmarkets.com/global/en/trading-accounts/ctrader-raw/). 

As with all things on the Forex market, there are many options and not all are good. 

The site may try to nudge you towards toward the EU jurisdiction regulated in Cyprus. Decline the offer, and when signing up check that the domain name ends in `.com` and not in `.eu`. 

[You can also choose your own broker on this page (look for `cTrader Copy Available`)](https://ctrader.com/featured-brokers/)

## I (already) have a cTrader account

Check if you have a Full Member (FM) trading account, otherwise you will not be able to copy any trades.

To check this, log in to https://ct.spotware.com and on the left click Copy. You should see the `FM` clearly for your account like this:

If your account doesn't have the `FM` badge it's either a Demo account or you unfortunately created a "Noob Member" account and have to treat your colleagues to cake üç∞

After the treat, quickly [get a working account so everyone can forget about your embarassment](https://www.icmarkets.com/global/en/trading-accounts/ctrader-raw/)

After starting the strategy you will notice that funds were deducted from your account and placed in a segregated account, just for this strategy. This segregated account will be active for as long as you copy the strategy. Also it will track the ROI on the right side.
